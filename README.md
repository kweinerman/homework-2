This page will be updated consistently as my journey through coding grows and my skillset becomes more refined.

**Usage**

From here you can access links to see my work in HTML/CSS, Java Script, and past works.

This will also give you links to find me on social media platforms and look further into my life and work!

**Fundamentals**

This page was designed using semantic HTML and CSS elements for stlying.

In it's current form. I struggled to aligned the flexbox elements with the "ME" section. 

I would like to add more elements to the portoflio that allow for file submissions and a more interactive experience for the users. 

**Additions**

For any future additions please reach out to me at kurt.weinerman@gmail.com before making any changes. 

Please be aware this is my personal portoflio and do not want to add others work on here.
